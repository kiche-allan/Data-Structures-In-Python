Hashing is a popular technique used in computer science to quickly search for data in a large dataset. However, since hashing involves mapping a large amount of data to a finite amount of hash values, collisions can occur. A collision occurs when two or more different keys are mapped to the same hash value.

There are several techniques to resolve collisions in hashing. Here are some of the commonly used ones:

Separate Chaining: In separate chaining, each bucket of the hash table is a linked list. When a collision occurs, the key-value pairs with the same hash value are stored in the linked list associated with that bucket.

Open Addressing: In open addressing, when a collision occurs, the hash function is re-applied to the key with a different formula until an empty bucket is found. There are several ways to implement open addressing such as linear probing, quadratic probing, and double hashing.

Robin Hood Hashing: Robin Hood hashing is similar to linear probing, but it rearranges the elements in a way that shorter linear probing sequences come first. This method ensures that the elements with the most number of collisions are placed last and are easily removed when a deletion is performed.

Cuckoo Hashing: In cuckoo hashing, each key has two possible hash locations. When a collision occurs, the key is moved to the alternate hash location. This process continues until an empty slot is found or the number of rehashes exceeds a certain limit.

These techniques are widely used in various applications of hashing and are effective in resolving collisions. The choice of collision resolution technique depends on the specific requirements of the application and the properties of the data being hashed.
