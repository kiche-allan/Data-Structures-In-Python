<!-- Hashing is a technique used in computer science to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. The resulting fixed-size value is often referred to as a hash, a digest, or a checksum.

The hashing process takes the input data (which can be any type of data, such as a string, a file, or an image) and applies a mathematical function to it that produces a unique fixed-size value. This value can then be used to quickly and efficiently identify the original data, as even a small change in the input data will result in a different hash value. -->
