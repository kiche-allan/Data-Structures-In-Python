A binary tree is a type of data structure that consists of nodes, each of which has at most 2 child nodes known as left and right child. The first node which has no parent is called the root node.

Each node in a binary tree typically contains a piece of data and the structure of the tree allows for efficient searching, sorting and other operations on the data. 

Binary trees can be used to represent a wide variety of hierachial relationship such as the structure of a file system, the organization of the company and the structure of the programming language. There are many different algorithms and techniques that can be used with binary trees such as the traversal algorithms foe  visiting all the nodes in the tree and balancing algorithms for ensuring that the tree is as balanced and efficient as possible.  

The root of a binary tree is the topmost node, and each node in the tree contains a value, often called the "key", which is typically used to search for, insert, or delete nodes in the tree. The left child of a node contains a value that is less than the value of the node, while the right child contains a value that is greater than or equal to the value of the node. This arrangement allows for efficient searching and sorting of data, since each comparison can eliminate half of the remaining nodes in the tree.

Traversal is an important operation on binary trees, and there are three commonly used methods for traversing a binary tree:

In-order traversal: In this method, the left subtree of each node is visited first, followed by the node itself, and then the right subtree. This traversal method is often used for printing the nodes of the tree in ascending order.

Pre-order traversal: In this method, the node itself is visited first, followed by its left subtree and then its right subtree. This traversal method is often used for creating a copy of the tree.

Post-order traversal: In this method, the left and right subtrees of a node are visited first, followed by the node itself. This traversal method is often used for deleting the nodes of the tree.

In addition to traversal, there are many other algorithms and techniques that can be used with binary trees, such as balancing algorithms to ensure that the tree is as efficient as possible, and search algorithms such as binary search to quickly find a specific value in the tree. Overall, binary trees are a powerful and versatile data structure that can be used to solve a wide range of problems in computer science and programming.

- Binary Tree is a family of data structure(BST, Heap tree, AVL, red black trees, Syntax tree)
Huffman coding problem, heap priority problem and expression parsing problem can be solved efficiently using binary trees

Types of Binary Trees

- Full Binary Tree
- Perfect Binary Tree
- Complete binary tree
- Balanced binary tree 

- Binary trees can be represented in two ways- one thru use of linked list and the other thru the use of arrays

Operations in a tree
- Creation of a Tree
- Insertion of a node
- Deletion of a node
- Search for a value
- Traverse all nodes
- Deletion of tree
