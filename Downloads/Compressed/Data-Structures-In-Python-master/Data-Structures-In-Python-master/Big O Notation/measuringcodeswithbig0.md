    1           - Any assignment statements and if statements that are executed once                   0(1)
                 regardless of the size of the problem

    2           - A simple for loop from 0 to n(with no internal loops)                                0(n)

    3           -A nested loop for the same type takes quadratic time complexity                       0(n^2)

    4           -A loop in which the controlling parameter is divided by two at each step              0(log n)

    5           -When dealing with multiple statements, just add them up
