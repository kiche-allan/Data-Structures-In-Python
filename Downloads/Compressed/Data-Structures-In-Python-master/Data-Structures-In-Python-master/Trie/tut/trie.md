A trie, also known as a prefix tree or digital tree, is a tree-like data structure used to store and search for strings. It is commonly used in programming to efficiently search for words or prefixes of words in a large set of strings.

In Python, a trie can be implemented using a class and nodes to represent the tree structure. Each node in the trie represents a character in the string, and the edges between nodes represent the next character in the string. The trie can be traversed recursively to search for words or prefixes.

Properties of the Trie for a set of the string:
The root node of the trie always represents the null node.
Each child of nodes is sorted alphabetically.
Each node can have a maximum of 26 children (A to Z).
Each node (except the root) can store one letter of the alphabet.

Basic operations of Trie
There are three operations in the Trie:

Insertion of a node
Searching a node
Deletion of a node
