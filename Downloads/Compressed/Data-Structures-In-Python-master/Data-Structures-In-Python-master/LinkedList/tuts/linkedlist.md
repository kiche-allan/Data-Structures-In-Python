A linkedlist is a data structure that consist of a group of nodes that are linked together in a linear fashion. Each node in a linked list contains a value and a reference to the next node in the list. In Python, u can implement a linked list using classes and objects

Linked List Complexity
Time Complexity

 	Worst case	Average Case
Search	O(n)	O(n)
Insert	O(1)	O(1)
Deletion	O(1)	O(1)

Space Complexity: O(n)

Linked List Applications

Dynamic memory allocation
Implemented in stack and queue
In undo functionality of softwares
Hash tables, Graphs
