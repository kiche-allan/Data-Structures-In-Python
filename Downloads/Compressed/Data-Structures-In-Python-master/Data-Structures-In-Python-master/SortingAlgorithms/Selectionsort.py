# Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by selecting the smallest element from an unsorted list and swapping it with the first element. The process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.

def selection_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n-1):
        min_index = i
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:
                min_index = j
        arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]
    return arr
