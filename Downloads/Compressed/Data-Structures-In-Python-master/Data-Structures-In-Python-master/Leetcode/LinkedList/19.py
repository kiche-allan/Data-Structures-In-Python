#explanation of every line of code
# This line defines a class Solution with a method removeNthFromEnd that takes in two arguments: a head node of a linked list and an integer n representing the node to be removed from the end of the linked list. This method returns the head of the updated linked list after the node is removed.

# Line 7-9 - 
# These lines initialize a dummy node with a value of 0 and set its next pointer to the head node. This dummy node is used to handle the case where the head node needs to be removed. Then, two pointers, left and right, are initialized with left pointing to the dummy node and right pointing to the head node.

# Line 11-13 - This loop moves the right pointer n nodes forward while n is greater than 0 and right is not None. This places the right pointer at the (n+1)th node from the end of the linked list.

#line 15-17 - This loop moves both the left and right pointers forward until the right pointer reaches the end of the linked list. This leaves the left pointer at the (n+1)th node from the end of the linked list.

#line 20-21 - This line sets the left pointer's next pointer to the node after the node to be removed. This removes the node from the linked list.

# This line removes the nth node by updating the next pointer of the left node to point to the node after the node to be removed. Finally, the method returns the head of the updated linked list, which is the next node of the dummy node.

# Overall, this code uses the two-pointer technique to remove the nth node from the end of the linked list with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), where n is the length of the linked list.
