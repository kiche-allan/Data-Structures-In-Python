An AVL Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. It was the first self-balancing binary search tree to be invented, and it is named after its inventors Adelson-Velsky and Landis.

In an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one. This balancing property ensures that the height of the tree is O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, which in turn ensures that operations such as search, insertion, and deletion take O(log n) time in the worst case.

The balancing property of an AVL tree is maintained through a process called rotation. When a node is inserted or deleted from an AVL tree, the tree may become unbalanced, meaning that the height of the left and right subtrees of some node differs by more than one. In such cases, one or more rotations are performed to restore the balance of the tree.

Overall, the AVL tree is a popular choice for applications where fast search, insertion, and deletion are required, and where the tree is frequently modified.

why we need an avl tree





We need an AVL tree because it provides a way to maintain the balance of a binary search tree automatically. A balanced tree ensures that search, insertion, and deletion operations have a guaranteed worst-case time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This makes the AVL tree an efficient data structure for applications that require frequent modifications of the tree and fast search operations.

If a binary search tree is not balanced, its height can become very large, and the worst-case time complexity of search, insertion, and deletion operations can become O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This can lead to poor performance for applications that require frequent modifications of the tree and fast search operations.

AVL trees ensure that the height of the tree is kept as small as possible, which in turn ensures that operations such as search, insertion, and deletion take O(log n) time in the worst case. This is achieved by maintaining a balance factor for each node in the tree and performing rotation operations to rebalanced the tree whenever the balance factor becomes greater than one or less than minus one.

Overall, AVL trees provide a way to maintain the balance of a binary search tree automatically, which in turn ensures efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.


The common operations for an AVL tree are:

Search: Given a key, search for the node in the AVL tree with that key. The time complexity of this operation is O(log n) in the worst case.

Insertion: Given a new key, insert a new node with that key into the AVL tree while maintaining the AVL tree's balance property. The time complexity of this operation is O(log n) in the worst case.

Deletion: Given a key, delete the node with that key from the AVL tree while maintaining the AVL tree's balance property. The time complexity of this operation is O(log n) in the worst case.

Tree traversal: Traverse the AVL tree in various orders, such as inorder, preorder, and postorder. These operations have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

Minimum and maximum: Find the node with the minimum and maximum key in the AVL tree. These operations have a time complexity of O(log n) in the worst case.

Successor and predecessor: Find the node with the next larger or smaller key than a given key in the AVL tree. These operations have a time complexity of O(log n) in the worst case.

Overall, the AVL tree supports all the basic operations of a binary search tree, while ensuring that the tree remains balanced, which in turn ensures efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

 Balance factor of a node in an avl is the diffeence between the height of the left subtree and that of the right subtree of that node
