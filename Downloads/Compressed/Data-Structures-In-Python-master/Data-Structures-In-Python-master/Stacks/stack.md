A stack is a linear data structure that operates in the Last In First Out(LIFO) princile, meaning that the last item added to the stack is the first one to be removed. It is an abstract data type that can be implemented as an array or linked list and it has two main operations - push and pop. 

The "push" operation adds an element to the top of the stack, while the "pop" operation removes the element from the top. When an element is popped, the next item in the stack becomes the new top element. The top of the stack is the element that was most recently pushed and is the next one to be popple.

Stacks are commonly used in many algorithms, such as depth-first search, evaluating expressions, and reversing strings, among others. They are also used in computer memory management, where they keep track of the function calls made during the execution of a program.

In summary, a stack is a simple yet powerful data structure that provides an efficient and convenient way to manage a collection of elements in a linear manner, where the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.
