A list in Python is a collection of ordered, mutable amnd heterogenous elements defined using square brackets[] and seperated by commas.

List elements can be accessed by indexing, and list length can be obtained using the len() function.
List are dynamic, meaning they can be modified, resized and elements can be added or removed - They are mutable

Some of the list methods:

append(): Adds an element to the end of the list
extend(): Adds multiple elements to the end of the list
insert(): Inserts an element at a specified position
remove(): Removes the first occurrence of a specified value
pop(): Removes the element at the specified position or the last element if index is not specified
index(): Returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value
count(): Returns the number of times a specified value appears in the list
sort(): Sorts the list elements in ascending order
reverse(): Reverses the order of the list elements.
