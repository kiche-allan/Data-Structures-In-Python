#drawbacks of list data structure
#one of thei major drawback is thei time complexity for inserting aor deleting elements at specific indices as it takes 0(n) time in the worst case where n is the number of elemets in the list. Tis can become an issue when dealing with large dataset and frequent insertions/deletions at specific indices


#common pitfalls
myList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]


#they modify their arguments and return null

myList = myList.sort()
print(myList)

myList2 = [3, 5, 6, 8, 8, 9, 6]

print(myList2)
