# Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

# The provided code is a method named rotate within a class named Solution. This method rotates an integer array nums to the right by k steps. It follows the same logic and implementation as described in my previous response.

# Here's how the code works:

# The method takes an integer array nums and an integer k as input.
# It determines the actual number of steps needed by taking the modulus (k %= len(nums)). This step ensures that the number of steps is within the range of the array length.
# It reverses the entire array nums using the reverse slice notation (nums[:] = nums[::-1]).
# It reverses the first k elements of the array using the same reverse slice notation (nums[:k] = nums[:k][::-1]).
# It reverses the remaining elements of the array using the reverse slice notation again (nums[k:] = nums[k:][::-1]).
# Finally, the method returns the modified array nums.
# The code provided correctly rotates the array to the right by k steps and returns the modified array.
