arrays is a data structure that stores collection of items typically of the same type/ The items are stored in a contigous block of memory and each memory and item can be accessed by its index

They are useful for tasks such as storing collection of data, such as list of intergers or a list of names. In most languages, arrays have a fixed size meaning the number of elements they can store is determined when they are created and cannot be changed later.



There are several types of arrays that can be used in programming, including:

One-dimensional arrays: These arrays have a single dimension and can store a linear collection of items. They are also known as vectors or lists.

Multi-dimensional arrays: These arrays have more than one dimension and can store a more complex collection of items. Examples include two-dimensional arrays (matrices) and three-dimensional arrays.

Static arrays: These arrays have a fixed size, meaning the number of elements they can store is determined when they are created and cannot be changed later.

Dynamic arrays: These arrays can change in size during the execution of a program. They are also known as resizable arrays.

Sparse arrays: These arrays are used to store a large collection of items, but most of the elements are empty or zero.

Associative arrays: These arrays use keys rather than indices to access elements, allowing for more flexibility when working with data. They are also known as maps, dictionaries, or hash tables.
