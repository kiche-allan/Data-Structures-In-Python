# vscode-styled-components

> This extension is based on [`styled-components/vscode-styled-components`](https://github.com/styled-components/vscode-styled-components) and has got rid of its language service because we found it interfere with typescript auto-completion. So this left us with a well-behaved extension with only highlighting feature.

Syntax highlighting for [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components).
